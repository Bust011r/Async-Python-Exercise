# Async Solution for Python performance exercise

## Write a Python script that downloads files from the internet and saves them in a download directory.
The list of URLs to download will be provided in a simple text file. URLs are separated by a newline. Assume that the files are small, so
downloading them does not require streaming.

The download directory should be provided as a command line parameter.

## Consider the following and propose reasonable solutions for the following problems:

1. How to handle HTTP 404 errors?
2. How to make the download process faster?
3. How to display the progress of downloads?
4. How to handle cancellation? (i.e., the user presses CTRL+C)
Optional:
5. How to handle retry in case of intermittent network errors?
